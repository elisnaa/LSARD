# Sample information

Patterns:
- Source: _POST ==> Filters:[]
- Sanitization: htmlentities_1 ==> Filters:[Filtered(", &, <, >)]
- Filters complete: Filters:[Filtered(", &, <, >)]
- Dataflow: assignment
- Context: sql_quotes
- Sink: mysqli_real_query_prm__<$>(db)

State:
- State: Good
- Exploitable: Not found
